# ED4U
A full-stack CRUD application that manages a tutoring service between its students, teachers, courses, and invoices.

The project is still in progress!

Goals:
1. Error handling for the Courses page. Once the tutor_id has been matched to the course_id, the tutor_id should either be greyed out or removed from the drop down menu. This constraint comes from the 1:1 relationship between tutors and courses.
2. Implement update functionality for Courses and Students page.
3. Continue to work on the design of the pages.
4. Migrate to Angular
5. Host on Heroku.
